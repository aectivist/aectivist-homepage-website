        <p class="description">Hi there! I'm Azriel. I'm currently learning a lot of things, and this is a part of it. This is my homepage, where I'll be recording a lot of the things I do for my own interest, and as a personal journal/log for growth.</p>

          <p class="boxdesc">I'm a 17 year old aspiring cyber security specialist, interested in a lot of things, such as gaming, art, chess, and programming (those are the main hobbies I have).
            I'm currently in 12th grade, however I've been learning a lot ever since I was young, for the future, so I can have the experience necessary.
            Similarly, I am also interested in diverse range of music, films, and animation. So, while I garner experience for my future career, I also express
          myself through different forms of art and media, which will be posted in this site.
