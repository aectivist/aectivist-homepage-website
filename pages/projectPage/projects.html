        <h2>Artistic Projects: Animation</h2>
        <p>Project Idea: 
          Animation is a very long process, but it is usually worth it
          in the end. Anyways, I envisioned bits of animations that I 
          could work on to gain skill and experiences that could help
          me for my own hobbies. I don't necessarily have a career minded
          towards animation, but I think that it would be a good skill to have
          in general. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Creation:
          The animations were made using ibis paint, which is where I usually 
          draw my art. In these animations, I was able to make a few animations
          that can be seen in the youtube page, where I post all my animations 
          that I've made over the past few months of creation.
          Animation usually consists of drawing an item frame by frame, which is 
          put together by ibis itself. Despite the limitations of ibis having a 
          minimum aspect ratio, I was able to make it work, and I was able to
          make small project animations such as cero or boom.

        <h2>Technology Projects: This website</h2>
        <p>Project Idea: this project was inspired by Persona 5. 
          Within the site, I envision what the necessary things of a 
          website would be, which was both front end and back end.
          Now, the front end was my favorite part, as I could customize 
          the site to my liking, and make it look like a game, hence 
          the models and the animations. The back end was a bit more
          different, as I had to learn how to use Node.js, and how to
          use it to make a server. This was a bit more difficult, but
          I managed to get it working. Similarly, I also worked on 
          getting the site to be responsive, which wasn't much of an issue
          but I thought of it to be a little tedious and challenging.
        </p>
        <p>Creation:
          The site utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end, 
          and Node.js for the back end. The models were found in SketchFab,
          (borrowed of course) and the animations were entirely made by me 
          using three.js. Additionally, the music was taken from the game,
          Persona 5, and the image of the Bar's background, the bottom-right 
          music button, and the loading loading-screen
          model for the home page was taken from the game as well.
          Additionally, the vinyl record was taken from pinterest, however, 
          I managed to make it so that whenever I clicked on the vinyl, it
          would stop, but when I click again, it would continue. Just like the 
          original vinyl record. The button on the bottom right changes 
          the music, and makes it so that whenever the music is changed, the vinyl
          moves out of frame, imitating the changing the vinyl record like in 
          real life. Out of all the pages I made, the bar was the best thing so far.

        <h2>Welcome to the bar!</h2>
        <p>This page is dedicated to new projects that are constantly updated. Logs will contain old projects, 
          and posts will contain updates on the projects. These new projects are seperated into two "pages". 
          The blue pages as seen are projects that are mainly based on technology or programming stuff, 
          while the red is for everything art. 
          Over all, this is to showcase some of the current things I am working on, for myself and for the 
          future. Enjoy your stay!
